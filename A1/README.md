## Assignment 1 

- This application uses Jetpack compose as the development toolkit for the UI.
- The app uses custom styles for the UI
- Composables have been used in the assignment wherever it made sense (if the component was reusable or atomic in nature)
- Components include LocationColumn (lazy/normal), LocationEntry, AtomicButton and AtomicProgressBar
- The list of locations has been hardcoded and the toggle between lazy UI and normal non-lazy UI is hardcoded within the code
- The app has been tested on Pixel 6, Pixel 3a and my own android phone Redmi 10s
